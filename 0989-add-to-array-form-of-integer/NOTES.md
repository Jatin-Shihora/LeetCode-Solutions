Continuing the example of 123 + 912, we start with [1, 2, 3+912]. Then we perform the addition 3+912, leaving 915. The 5 stays as the digit, while we 'carry' 910 into the next column which becomes 91.
â€‹
We repeat this process with [1, 2+91, 5]. We have 93, where 3 stays and 90 is carried over as 9. Again, we have [1+9, 3, 5] which transforms into [1, 0, 3, 5].
