Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
​
**Intuition:-**
There is not much of a intuition in this question as the question is loud and clear about it's use of bit manipulation .
​
To make things a bit more interesting let's do this question with and wihout bit manipulation
​
**Using Bit Manipulations*
​
**Code1:-**
```
class Solution {
public:
int findComplement(int num) {
unsigned mask = ~0;
while( mask & num ) mask = mask << 1;
return ~num ^ mask;
}
};
```
