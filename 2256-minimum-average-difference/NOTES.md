* First we sim of all elements and stored in the right_sum.
* And then we declare and intialize left_sum=0 and index=0.
* index contains which INDEX have minimum Average difference.
* By traversing nums we add element in left_sum and then we removed that element in right_sum to find an average of every index.
* return index
