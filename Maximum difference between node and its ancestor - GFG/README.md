# Maximum difference between node and its ancestor
## Medium 
<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">Given a Binary Tree, you need to find the maximum value which you can get by subtracting the value of node B from the value of node A, where A and B are two nodes of the binary tree and A is an ancestor of B.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>&nbsp;   5
 / &nbsp; &nbsp;\
2 &nbsp; &nbsp;  1
<strong>Output: </strong>4<strong>
Explanation:</strong>The maximum difference we can
get is 4, which is bewteen 5 and 1.</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>&nbsp;     1
 &nbsp;&nbsp; / &nbsp;  \
 &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 7
<strong>Output: </strong>-1<strong>
Explanation:</strong>The maximum difference we can
get is -1, which is between 1 and 2.</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
The task is to complete the function <strong>maxDiff</strong>() which finds the maximum difference between the node and its ancestor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(N).<br>
<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong>&nbsp;O(H).<br>
Note: H is the height of the tree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
1 &lt;= Number of edges &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup><br>
0 &lt;= Data of a node &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></span></p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The <strong>Input/Output</strong> format and <strong>Examples</strong> given are used for the system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for <strong>Expected Output</strong> only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from the stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.</p>
