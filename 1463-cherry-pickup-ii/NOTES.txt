**Intuition 5:-**
Remember there was one case where there is a clash of position in robos . Like both the robos moved to the same position , In this case we can simply use a `if condition` to give the cherry's to one robo .
`(c1 == c2) ? (dp[r][c1][c2] = prevMax + grid[r][c1]) : (dp[r][c1][c2] = prevMax + grid[r][c1] + grid[r][c2]) ;`
​
**Intuiton 6:-**
Let's collect our thought for this intuition.
Till now we can decide the dimensions of dp, Recursion formula , one edge case of collision. So we can say that we will be needing 3ree for loops .You say why and I say this becuase we will be needing one for loop for iterating rows & Two for the columns
​
**Last Intuition:-**
Pheww that was a lot of understanding .
Now in the end we just need to compute the maximum of the last dp row of the dp array by using `res = max ( res, dp[m - 1][i][j] )`
