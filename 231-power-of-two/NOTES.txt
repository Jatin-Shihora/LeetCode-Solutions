**5. LMAO method**
We are literally gonna take the advantage of the constraints. I  dont recommend you all to use this method during your interviews. It's a fun method . Do this on your own, you will enjoy it ;))
* *Hint:Constraints [-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1] also 2^30 is 1073741824 *
```
class Solution {
public:
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
if(n==0) return false;
return (n>0)&&(1073741824%n==0);
}
};
