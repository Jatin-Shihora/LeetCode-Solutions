/*
Intuition: we can double all odd numbers first, so we can get forget of the second operation. Now, we only need to decrease the largest number - while it's even, which results a very simple solution.

1. Traverse the vector and double all the odd vector elements. This nullifies the requirement for the 2nd operation.
2. Now, decrease the largest vector element while itâ€™s even.
3. To store the vector elements in sorted manner, insert all vector elements into a Set.
4. Greedily reduce the maximum element present in the Set
5. If the maximum element present in the Set is odd, break the loop.
6. Print the minimum deviation obtained.
